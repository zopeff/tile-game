So far... 
It all started when the youngest was looking for some way to make a game. I found this http://www.crunchzilla.com/code-monster because it seemed simple enough and had a visual component.
It uses canvas, which i never used before and a few minutes playing with the editor (not doing what the tool was intended to do) I had a few boxes bouncing around in the square.
However, after a few hours, that got a little too limiting to work with and I decided to jump out of that window and into a normal editor and basic html page. Playing with the canvas reminded me of all the time I spent in my teens and early college days building game engines and games.
From there I found some character gfx from legend of zelda on the SNES and suddenly... why not go a little further and try and create a zelda like game!

Made a rough list of things to do and then got to work making a basic map by filling a 50x50 grid with grass tiles. That got hard to manage when I wanted to add other tiles and did a quick google and found the mapmaker.org site. This tool is pretty easy to get started with and suddenly, I had a real map with some interesting things in it. 

.... This might actually be something ...
